-- Ql : Does this table have everything you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?

select *
from dsv1069.final_assignments_qa


--Answer : No











-- Q2 : Write a query and table creation statement to make final_assignments_qa look like the final_assignments table. 
--If you discovered something missing in part 1, you may fill in the value with a place holder of the appropriate data type.

--( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence. 


-- order binary : -15% â€“ 11% (-2.2%) pvalue = 0.74

-- view binary : -1.4% â€“ 6.5% (2.6%) pvalue = 0.2

-- Therefore, there is no significant difference for item_test_2 in view binary and order binary
